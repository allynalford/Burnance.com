                        a few successful companies, I work my ass off and trade
                        daily, lately pretty much all day. I trade with the best
                        of the best and do pretty damn well with it, proof in my
                        posts. Also, you bet your a$$ I built this site myself,
                        as you can tell I am far from a developer, but have my
                        kickass team who is great- we will use them later. I’m
                        also fully doxxed, you can see on my social medias
                        (IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickalbs/" target="_new">@nickalbs</a> twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/nickalbs1" target="_new">@nickalbs1</a>)- you want to know more

                      <h3 className="title">The How:</h3>
                  <p className="text mb-4">
                    So, I’ve been thinking about dropping a project, running
                    "the how's," "the what's" and "the why's" all through my
                    head. I thought of many ideas and I landed on the direction
                    I wanted to go. I never thought I would get this immersed
                    into the web3/trading space, but here I am. This space has
                    opened so many opportunities/networking, and even made some
                    great friends on this chaotic journey. Thinking it all
                    through, we all know the most valuable projects are the true
                    organic ones.&nbsp;
                    <b>
                      I felt it definitely would be cool to drop an organic
                      project, with no expectations, but already packed with
                      UTILITY from day 1!

                    So, like I said I trade with the best of the best covering
                    all assets (NFT/Crypto/Stocks). Trading comes first for me!
                    I thought about starting an alpha group, but to be honest, I
                    do not want the liability and pressure to keep everyone
                    happy. That being said, I will always share all my insight
                    and “whys” of my trades and set ups, answer all questions
                    and educate anyone who needs. What I enjoy more is a vibing
                    community{' '}

                    To me true value is organic growth. And the MAIN reason I
                    don't want to run an alpha group is simple, there is no
                    need, I ride with my two main alpha groups <a href="https://twitter.com/BeastNFTs" target="_new">@BeastNFTs</a> and
                    &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/CyberTurtlesNFT" target="_new">@CyberTurtlesNFT</a>, which, if your serious about trading and
                    learning- those are the alpha groups to be in{' '}

                  <p className="text mb-4">
                    What I do love doing is entertaining while trading and
                    showing the true sweat and pain that goes into it, some of
                    you may have witnessed it yourself already. Which is where I
                    came up with my idea for my community called Takin Shots. My
                    whole life, and when you think about most people's lives,
                    they are built on Takin Shots. The community will be more
                    built through social media and youtube channel and of course
                    discord. The community will be highly entertained on all my
                    degenerate activities, behind the scenes of some badass
                    stuff, and probably gain tons of knowledge especially with
                    growing and scaling real life business. I’m absolutely sure
                    there will be much education throughout, like I said I run a
                    few successful companies, and do pretty decent at trading.
